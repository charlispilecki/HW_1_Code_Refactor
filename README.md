# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The scope of this work involved improving the user's code to make it cleaner, improve SEO, and have semantic HTML elements instead of generic div elements.  

For the HTML, the main changes I made were:
* adding a title
* adding descriptive alt tags to images
* replacing divs with semantic HTML elements
* made note of changes with comments

For the CSS, the main changes I made were:
* consolidating repetitive classes to reduce duplicate code
* made note of changes with comments
